# Homework 2 Instructions

This project contains two HTML files, each styled with its corresponding CSS file.

## Files and Their Corresponding Stylesheets

- `hw2-1.html` → uses `style.css`
- `hw2-2.html` → uses `style2.css`

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the HTML files in any modern web browser:
   - Double-click `hw2-1.html` to view it with `style.css` applied.
   - Double-click `hw2-2.html` to view it with `style2.css` applied.

> Make sure the HTML and CSS files are kept in the same directory, as they are linked using relative paths.

## Notes

No additional setup is required. This project is purely front-end (HTML + CSS).
